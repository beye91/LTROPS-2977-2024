# LTROPS-2977-2024

** LTROPS-2977: 4 domains in 1 pipeline: Cross-domain Automation with Cisco Catalyst Center, ACI, Firewalls and NDFC using NetDevOps approaches **

Building a cross-domain automation pipeline with multiple domains can help simplify and speed up the process of configuration deployment from the development to the production environment.

In this lab session, you will work to build the bridge between different domains and include all in an automated CI/CD pipeline using a variety of NetDevOps tools.

Using CI/CD practices can also help reduce the risk of human error and improve the overall quality of configuration deployments.
Upon completion of this lab, you will be able to:

Getting started with NetDevOps tooling
Push configuration to all 4 domains using Ansible or Terraform
Validate your code and use automated testing to verify results with Robot Framework
Build CI/CD pipelines using GitLab
Secure your secrets using HashiCorp Vault
Create your own Docker container
